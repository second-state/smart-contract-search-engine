README.md

Please overwrite the files in the repository, with the files in this directory, in order to configure this cryptokittie instance. Obviously you will need your own Infura URL (Ethereum MainNet RPC and your own AWS Elasticsearch instance). This section is just a place to store alternative configuration and make customisations without updating the core source code of the project.
