# README
This is a collection of files which were used during the development phase of this product. Most of them import from the main harvest.py file (which reads the appropriate config etc) and allow us to perform specific tasks with the harvester (call individual functions of the harvest.py file etc.). If you would like to use one of these simply move it directly into the python directoy and run it there i.e.

cp -rp theFile.py ../../python
cd ../../python
python3.6 theFile.py
