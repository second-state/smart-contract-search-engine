# Smart Contract Search Engine

# 100% Ethereum compatible
If you would like to set up a smart contract search engine one or more of your contracts on Ethereum, Ethereum Classic or any other Ethereum compatible network, please get in touch so we can get you up and running.

## Easy to use API
You can now access all of the data within the smart contract search engine via [a handy API called es-ss.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/es-ss.js). This allows your DApp to query all information simply by writing a little Javascript or Node.js code.

## Example of a DApp which uses the smart contract search engine and the API

### General search

You can search for smart contracts on the blockchain without even installing a wallet or Chrome extension. Simply click "Search" to get all results, or type in contract addresses and text to filter the results.

### Personalized search using predefined queries

If you want to take it a step further, you can download the [CyberMiles Chrome Extension](https://www.cybermiles.io/en-us/blockchain-infrastructure/venus/) and intimately search the block chain in the context of your very own accounts. Here is a quick demonstration.

### Pre defined queries

You can click any of the 3 pre defined queries. The results are based on the address in your browsers wallet ([i.e. CyberMiles Venus Chrome Extension](https://www.cybermiles.io/en-us/blockchain-infrastructure/venus/))
