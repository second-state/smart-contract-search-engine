### Personalized search using predefined queries

If you want to take it a step further, you can download the [CyberMiles Chrome Extension](https://www.cybermiles.io/en-us/blockchain-infrastructure/venus/) and intimately search the block chain in the context of your very own accounts. Here is a quick demonstration.

### Pre defined queries

You can click any of the 3 pre defined queries. The results are based on the address in your browsers wallet ([i.e. CyberMiles Venus Chrome Extension](https://www.cybermiles.io/en-us/blockchain-infrastructure/venus/))
