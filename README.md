# Smart Contract Search Engine

## Local vs Global

This search engine is designed to run in two modalities:
- local, single end-user mode (without the need for a server). See [local-mode documentation](./documentation/local_mode.md)
- global, multiple end-user mode (where the search engine is made available to the world via a server). See [global-mode documentation](documentation/global_mode.md)

## Frontend Demonstration

We have put together a: 
- live TestNet [demonstration of the search engine running on the CyberMiles TestNet](http://54.252.173.219)
- live MainNet [demonstration of the search engine running on the CyberMiles MainNet](http://13.211.31.225)

Specifically, we have indexed this particular [Product Giveaway Smart Contract](https://github.com/CyberMiles/smart_contracts/blob/master/FairPlay/FairPlay.lity) from both the aforementioned networks (TestNet and MainNet).

You can download the [CyberMiles Chrome Extension](https://www.cybermiles.io/en-us/blockchain-infrastructure/venus/) and create your very own Giveaways.
