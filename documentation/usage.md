# Usage
*Update:* We now have a simple way to interact with the search engine via simple Javascript syntax. Please see our [es-ss.js library](https://github.com/second-state/es-ss.js) for more details.

The search engine can be used, by end users, via their web browser. It can also provide data to users and machines via the public facing API.

## API usage - using curl at the command line

```bash
curl -X GET "https://testnet.cmt.search.secondstate.io/api/es_search" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d' {"query": {"match": {"contractAddress": "0x909350a510BCf568e66019E21F1598D8282be26C"}}}'
```
Returns
```bash

The above examples demonstrate how to query the `api/es_search` endpoint. The great thing about the `api/es_search` endpoint is that it is 100% Elasticsearch (DSL Query) compatible. Please see the official Elasticsearch documentation for more information about:
- [Match all Queries](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-match-all-query.html), 
- [Full text queries](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/full-text-queries.html), 
- [Exists query](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-exists-query.html), 
- [Wildcard query](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-wildcard-query.html)

# Contract Instance Versioning

A frontend application can calculate and define a label for a particlar version of a contract instance. For example there may be a smart contract initiative like the [FairPlay](https://github.com/CyberMiles/smart_contracts/tree/master/FairPlay) "Product Giveaway" which gets upgraded with new features i.e. the [version 1](https://github.com/CyberMiles/smart_contracts/tree/master/FairPlay/v1) smart contract still exists but the business expands the Product Giveaway's functionality (with new features) and calls this [version 2](https://github.com/CyberMiles/smart_contracts/tree/master/FairPlay/v2). It is important that the end users know which version they are seeing in the search results.

The smart contract search engine provide a very flexible mechanism for smart contract versioning. 
This is how it work. 
The smart contract search engine:
- creates a deterministic hash of the each known ABI (sorting the keys inside the ABI for absolute determinism) 
- goes through every block, every transaction and every known ABI and maintains a list of the deteministic ABI hashes (as a list data field containing one or more Sha3) inside every indexed smart contract instance)
- creates a deterministic hash of each known Bytecode 
- goes through every block, every transaction and every known Bytecode and maintains a field (a single Sha3) inside every smart contract instance

At any given time, each smart contract instance (which is indexed) has a list of ABI hashes and a single Bytecode hash. This allows end users to search the search engine for contracts of a particular genre i.e. return all of the ERC20 compatible contracts etc (using the Sha3 hash of the ERC20 ABI as a filter). 

Of course some smart contract instances might be compatible with multiple ABI standards; this is why there is a list of ABI hashes as apposed to just one ABI has per contract instance.

DApp developers can:
- use any combination of ABI hashes (and the single Bytecode hash) to uniquely identify a given contract
- create the deterministic hashes themselves and build their frontend application ahead of time regardless of what is or isn't in the search engine at that point in time (the hashes are deterministic and once a contract instance is deployed it will always be able to be found in the search engine via the hashes)
- use simple code, like the following Javascript, to dynamically set the contract version in the frontend display of the DApp.

```Javascript
// The ABI of their smart contract
abi1Sha3 = "0x462e4b9caf0a0f1355cf55d46b7f6da2b3812eec59c230e23f743b77dac4491c";
// The ABI of another smaller smart contract which is also available internally
abi2Sha3 = "0x2222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222";
// Another example of a smaller contract i.e. the overall large smart contract might have internal ERC20 or ERC721 functionality
abi3Sha3 = "0x3333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333";
// Bytecode hash (which is also able to be deterministically generated by the frontend developer ahead of time)
bytecodeSha3 = "0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567";
// Once the data is returned to the frontend, this simple and fast code can be used to set the version number for display
if (_responseData.includes(abi1Sha3) && _responseData.includes(abi2Sha3) && _responseData.includes(abi3Sha3) && _responseData.includes(bytecodeSha3)){
    version = "v1"
}
```
**Why versioning?**
It is highly likely that each new version will have different logic and/or different public functions and variables (a result of the upgrade from v1 to v2). Being able to deterministically set the version means that the frontend can display data in different ways for each different version i.e. version 2 might have a new field called date and the frontend is going to need to know how to display the date. This date formatting/display will be wasted on version because it won't even have a date field (which may even cause an error in the frontend display). This is why being able to determine the versioning is important.
