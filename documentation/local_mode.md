# Local Mode

Running this smart contract search engine in local mode can be done by simply downloading the project and opening the index.html file in your web browser.

The data for this local mode operation is provided by an open and public Elasticsearch endpoint.

This is really only intended for prototyping, development and testing. The reason being, if the Elasticsearch endpoint is open then anyone can access, modify, delete the data. Seeings how blockchain data is completely public and open, running this search engine in local mode can facilitate rapid development and prototyping. 

If you would like to run the smart contract search engine in a production environment (as part of your DApp etc, please see the documentation for [global mode](./global_mode.md)).
