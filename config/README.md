# README
This configuration area is only used for the **Docker** style deployment [which is documented here](https://github.com/second-state/smart-contract-search-engine/tree/master/docker). 
Please visit the other [documentation section](https://github.com/second-state/smart-contract-search-engine/tree/master/documentation) if you would like to deploy a smart contract search engine without using Docker (i.e. manually installing and configuring your own Apache2, Flask, etc).
